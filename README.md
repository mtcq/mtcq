### Hallo! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Marco TÃºlio Quintino, associate professor (maÃ®tre de confÃ©rences) in computer science at [Sorbonne UniversitÃ©](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/), Paris, France. I'm a member of the [Quantum Information](https://www.lip6.fr/recherche/team_membres.php?acronyme=QI) team at [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/), a joint research instute of [Sorbonne UniversitÃ©](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/).

My main research is in the field of quantum information and quantum computation, in particular: quantum correlations, causality in quantum theory, higher-order quantum operations, Bell nonlocality, quantum steering, entanglement, measurement incompatibility, quantum discrimination tasks, and Semidefinite Programming.

I use this space in GitHub mainly to host and share the computational code used I develop for my papers and my research. Please donâ€™t hesitate in contacting me if you spot any sort of bug or if you want to discuss any particular code. =)

All my scientific papers are available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/quintino_m_1.html) and some statistics involving them can be found at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9S-Jrs4AAAAJ&hl).

You can find more information about me and my research at my personal website: [https://mtcq.github.io](https://mtcq.github.io).
