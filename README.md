### Hallo! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Marco TÃºlio Quintino, a researcher in quantum information who is currently based at [IQOQI Vienna](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/esq/home/esq-postdocs/postdoc-application/current-esq-postdocs/quintino-marco-tulio) and the University of Vienna at the group of [ÄŒaslav Brukner](https://www.quantumfoundations.org/people.html) with an [ESQ fellowship](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/esq/home/esq-postdocs/postdoc-application/current-esq-postdocs/quintino-marco-tulio). My main research interests are higher-order quantum operations, designing quantum circuits to transform quantum operations, quantum discrimination tasks, Bell nonlocality, and quantum foundations.

I use this space in GitHub mainly to host and share the computational code used I develop for my papers and my research. Please donâ€™t hesitate in contacting me if you spot any sort of bug or if you want to discuss any particular code. =)

All my scientific papers are available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/quintino_m_1.html) and some statistics involving them can be found at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9S-Jrs4AAAAJ&hl).

You can find more information about me and my research at my personal website: [https://mtcq.github.io](https://mtcq.github.io).
